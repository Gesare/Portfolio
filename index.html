        <p>

           <h4 class="one"><strong> Education</strong></h4>
           <p class="two"> I attended strathmore university from april 2016 and will be graduating this June 2020. I studied bachelor of business and information technology<br> And currently attending Moringa school. </p>
           <h4 class="one"><strong> Job experience</strong></h4>
           <p class="two"> <ul>
               <li> 2017 : <span class="uni"> Feed the Children </span> </li>
               <li> 2019 : <span class="uni"> COSEKE </span> </li>
               <li> 2019 : <span class="uni"> Treasury Office of controller of budget </span> </li>
           </ul> </p>
           <p class="two"> I decided to take a programming class because code is everything.In the world that we live in it revolves around technology hence by taking programming i get to learn and explore.programming is a career that can be performed from anywhere you can carry a laptop computer and that gives you access to the Internet. If you are employed by a specific company as a computer programmer, you are also typically given a lot of flexibility to complete jobs from home or to maintain less-than-regular work shifts, as long as the projects you are assigned are completed on time</p>
